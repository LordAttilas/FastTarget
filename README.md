# FastTarget
Windower 4 addon for FFXI that allow quicker target change

Allows instant override of manual lock, in-combat lock, action menu lock, or chat history lock for faster target switching at any time using the default Tab, Alt-Tab, and F8 keys. In game wizard to map additional custom keys for target left, right and nearest.

This allow to change target while in combat without having to select 'Switch target' from the menu and not having to release a target lock when out of combat. Additionnaly allow to force a target change even if in first level of most in-game menu.

Automatic best target search using the in-game sub-targeting system with F8 or custom key. Optional sub-target queue for automatic target switch when the current target die. Track if a spell or job ability was used (using <stnpc> or <st>) to pull a different mob that then current one and set it automatically as next queued target.

In-game minimalist GUI that display distance, health point of current target, sub-target mode and if a target is queued (Work in progress).

**Recommended to still use the in-game “/autotarget on”, since it may help avoid storing your weapon between fights in lag-heavy environments, at the cost of briefly switching targets twice when your current target dies. This can especially happen if someone else kills your target. At least it allows you to pre-select the target target you want or keep fighting if you forget to do so beforehand.
